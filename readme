Some functions for work with stm32 arm microcontrollers in EMACS.

Video of work: https://youtu.be/M7RBQsq5_lc

Required:
1) CEDET
2) python
3) cmake
4) st-link https://github.com/texane/stlink
//5) https://github.com/SL-RU/STM32CubeMX_cmake

Install:
1) clone repository to /.emacs.d/stm32
2) execute "git submodule update --init" to clone STM32CubeMX_cmake to /.emacs.d/stm32/STM32CubeMX_cmake
3) Change paths to yours in stm32.el
4) add to your init file (require 'stm32)

Commentary:
WORK IN PROGRESS!!!111111
1) Create STM32CubeMx project and generate it for SW4STM32
2) M-x stm32-new-project RET *select CubeMX project path*
3) open main.c
4) C-c . C to compile
5) connect stlink to your PC
6) stm32-run-st-util to start gdb server
7) start GDB debugger with stm32-start-gdb
8) in gdb) "load" to upload file to MC and "cont" to run.For more see https://github.com/texane/stlink
9) good luck!

To load that project after restart you need to (stm32-load-project).Or you can add to your init file (stm32-load-all-projects) for automatic loading.

After CubeMx project regeneration or adding new libraries or new sources you need to do M-x stm32-cmake-build

For normal file & header completion you need to (global-semantic-idle-scheduler-mode 1) in your init file.

So in init can be that:

(stm32-load-all-projects)

(global-semantic-idle-scheduler-mode 1)
